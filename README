This is actually a QWidget that shows your user some pretty colorful animation.
You can easily put this inside your own QWidgets, QMainWindows, etc.

Automaton step rule:
Cell colors are sorted and enumerated. Cell can change its color only
to succeeding color (with respect to its current color). And it changes
only if at least one of its eight neighbor cell have this succeding color.

This thing also have a few keyboard control keys:
    +, -     -- change (increase or decrease) scaling factor
    ], [     -- change color amount
    spacebar -- change color scheme.
    R        -- restart automaton.
